A Basic Introduction to Epidemic Modelling
===========================================

The standard technique to model the spread of epidemics is by using
something called a **compartmental model**. In such models, individuals
can be in one of a number of compartments (or "states"), and can
transition between them as time goes by. In the following section we
will study a very basic, but surprisingly effective model, the **SIR
model.**
