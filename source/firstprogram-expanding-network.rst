
Expanding the Network
=====================

Ealier we had one location class which was the ``House``. In this section we increase the location classes to ``House``,  ``Office``, and ``School``. Every person has a unique house and either an office or a school and this categorized on the basis of age. 

Implementing multiple houses, offices, and schools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mention while creating the ``House.scala`` class, we mentioned that each of the locations will require a separate class. In addition to the new location classes, the person class needs to updated to establish the relationships. 

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Office.scala 

    This scala class defines the relationship betweeen the agent of type ``Person`` and ``Office``.  Again since there are numerous offices, the datatype required is Long. 

  .. group-tab:: School.scala

    This scala class defines the relationship betweeen the agent of type ``Person`` and ``School``.  Again since there are numerous schools, the datatype required is Long. 

  .. group-tab:: Person.scala 

    This is the same as last class we defined but now we have to add relationships that corresponds to the relationships define in the Network classes earlier.

The main file doesnt need major alterations, but the changes that have to be implemented are crucial conceptually and for the program to give the correct output. The majority of the changes are in two areas which are

* Categorization of people: We have different locations in the network but only one type of Person. We need to make a distinction and categorize the individuals to send them to different locations. In this section, the categorization is done on the basis of age; any over the age of 18 works in an office and anyone under the age of 18 goes to a school. After creating these different people, we need to define the relationship between the people and their respective nodes. All these changes are made in the csvDataExtractor. 

.. note:: The age of the citizens are provided in the input csv file. 

* createSchedules: Now that we have defined office-goers and school-goers, we need to decide their schedules and timings. 

The csvDataExtractor function is the same and changes are made after the nodes (house, citizen) and relationship (house and person) is defined. Regardless of the age of the individual, they still have a house that they are associated to and therefore no changes are required when defining the aforementioned nodes and relationships. The next part is adding new nodes and relationships for individuals and their additional network and this is rather straightforward. An if condition is used to categorize on the basis of age and in the conditional block the relationships and nodes are added, similar to the house and citizen case. 

.. code-block:: scala 

    if (age >= 18) {
      val office = Office(officeId)
      val worksAt = Relation[Person, Office](citizenId, "WORKS_AT", officeId)
      val employerOf = Relation[Office, Person](officeId, "EMPLOYER_OF", citizenId)

      graphData.addNode(officeId, office)
      graphData.addRelations(worksAt, employerOf)
    } else {
      val school = School(schoolId)
      val studiesAt = Relation[Person, School](citizenId, "STUDIES_AT", schoolId)
      val studentOf = Relation[School, Person](schoolId, "STUDENT_OF", citizenId)

      graphData.addNode(schoolId, school)
      graphData.addRelations(studiesAt, studentOf)
    }


Implementing Schedules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After this distinction has been made, the changes in schedules have to be made. Employee and student schedule are just when they leave for their the house and when they return. First we need to define an hour to be ``myTick`` and there are 24 hours in ``myDay``. Before ``create24HourSchedules`` can be made, ``myTick`` and ``myDay`` needs to be defined outside the main function. 

.. code-block:: scala 

    private val myTick: ScheduleUnit = new ScheduleUnit(1)
    private val myDay: ScheduleUnit = new ScheduleUnit(myTick * 24)

With these values defined, ``create24HourSchedules`` can be made. However, when there are more than one schedules running, there needs to be a priority list that needs to be made. In this case, Student and Employee schedules are independent of each other so a either schedules can be prioritized over the other. In later cases, quarantine will be introduced where individuals will stay at their house the whole time and this gets priority over office and school schedules. 

.. code-block:: scala 

    private def create24HourSchedules()(implicit context: Context): Unit = {
      val employeeSchedule = (myDay, myTick)
        .add[House](0, 8)
        .add[Office](9, 17)
        .add[House](18,23)

      val studentSchedule = (myDay, myTick)
        .add[House](0, 8)
        .add[Office](9, 16)
        .add[House](17, 23)

      registerSchedules(
        (employeeSchedule, (agent: Agent, _: Context) => agent.asInstanceOf[Person].age >= 18, 1),
        (studentSchedule, (agent: Agent, _: Context) => agent.asInstanceOf[Person].age < 18, 2)
      )
    }

.. note:: The timings of departure and return are to be made in the 24 hour format.  


Handling Current Locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now, we also need to handle the location of the individual at every step to ensure that the individual is only in contact with the people in the same location. This is done by adding a new ``currentLocation`` parameter in the ``Person`` class. In order to implement this, we add a new attribute to the ``Person`` class called ``currentLocation`` which stores the exact current location of the agent. This attribute has to be dynamically updated at every time-step based on the agent's schedule. This is done by adding a new behaviour ``updateCurrentLocation``. This is implemented below.

.. code-block:: scala

    // Modifying the Person class to include the currentLocation attribute
    case class Person(id: Long, age: Int, infectionState: InfectionStatus, infectionDay: Int, currentLocation: String = "") extends Agent {


Before we implement the ``updateCurrentLocation`` behaviour, we need understand the ``Some`` and ``Option`` classes in Scala. The ``Option`` class is a container that represents optionality and it may or may not contain a value. The ``Some`` and ``None`` classes are subclasses of the ``Option`` class. If the value is present, it is wrapped in a ``Some`` class, otherwise it is wrapped in a ``None`` class. You can read more about them over `here <https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/fp-functional-error-handling.html#using-optionsomenone>`_. Then, we can implement the following code:
 
.. code-block:: scala 

    // Adding a behaviour to update the current location of the person
    private def getCurrentLocation(context: Context): Option[String] = {
      val schedule = context.fetchScheduleFor(this).get
      val currentStep = context.getCurrentStep
      val placeType: String = schedule.getForStep(currentStep)

      Some(placeType)
    }

    private def updateCurrentLocation(context: Context): Unit = {
      val currentLocationOption = getCurrentLocation(context)
      currentLocationOption match {
        case Some(x) => {
          if (this.currentLocation != x) {
            updateParam("currentLocation", x)
          }
        }

        // Case: 'None' is returned
        case _ => 
      }
    }

    addBehaviour(updateCurrentLocation)

We then also need to update the ``checkForInfection`` function to only check for infections in the same location. This is important because currently, the infection rate for a person is calculated based on the total number of people connected to the person, regardless of their location decided by the schedule (Work/School/Home). This is not accurate, as a person can only infect others, or get infected by others, if they are in the same location at the same time.

We implement this by counting the total number of people in the Person's current location, and then count the number of infected people in the same location. Then, we modify our infection rate calculation to be based on the number of infected people in the same location.

.. code-block:: scala

    import com.bharatsim.engine.graph.patternMatcher.MatchCondition._

    val neighbours = decodedPlace.getConnections(decodedPlace.getRelation[Person]().get)
    val totalNeighbourCount = decodedPlace.getConnectionCount(decodedPlace.getRelation[Person]().get, ("currentLocation" equ currentLocation))

    if (totalNeighbourCount > 0) {
      val infectedNeighbourCount = decodedPlace
        .getConnectionCount(decodedPlace.getRelation[Person]().get, ("currentLocation" equ currentLocation) and ("infectionState" equ Infected))

      val finalInfectionRate = infectionRate * infectedNeighbourCount / totalNeighbourCount
      val toBeInfected = biasedCoinToss(finalInfectionRate)

      if (toBeInfected) {
        updateParam("infectionState", Infected)
      }
    }
